# Fitness Tracker
For this assignment, you'll create a workout tracker. You have already been provided with the front end code in the `Develop` folder. This assignment will require you to create Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.

## User Story
* Using this app, a person can view, create and track daily workouts. They are able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. They can also track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, it is possible to track the distance traveled.  A user will reach their goals more quickly if they are able to track the progress of their workouts.

## Acceptance Criteria
When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout.

The user should be able to:
  * Add exercises to a previous workout plan.
  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.
  * View the combined weight of multiple exercises on the `stats` page.

To deploy an application with a MongoDB database to Heroku, you'll need to set up a MongoDB Atlas account and connect a database from there to your application. Be sure to use the following guides for support:

  * [Set Up MongoDB Atlas](../04-Important/MongoAtlas-Setup.md)
  * [Deploy with Heroku and MongoDB Atlas](../04-Important/MongoAtlas-Deploy.md)

## Submission on BCS
* The URL to the deployed application
* The URL to the GitHub repository
